Vorto Algorithmic Challenge

python3 evaluateShared.py --cmd "python3 ./belousVRP.py" --problemDir "./Training Problems"

The program attempt to use a genetic algorithm to heuristically come up with a schedule for drivers in a vehicle routing problem given by Vorto.
Currently, it has many areas for improvement. :)
